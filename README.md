## Map-Reduce

The main result of the project is of course the Map-Reduce code which is implemented in "Etape 9". In order to run it one has to compile and produce Slave.jar, Deploy.jar, and Master.jar. Not to forget to write the machines one wishes to use in machines.txt that should be in the same directory of the Master and Deploy jar files.

That being done, one has only to run Deploy.jar to deploy the Slave.jar on the distant machines, and then run the Master.jar to run the whole Map-Reduce job. 
The Master is almost in mode verbose as it describes all the stages and outputs of the mapping, shufflind and reducing in order to make it easy to follow and test.

## TP questions

The relevant answers to the previous TP questions are presented in the Etape0.java (for the sequential code), and the folder Etape 4-8 that answers the mentioned Etapes of the TP.
